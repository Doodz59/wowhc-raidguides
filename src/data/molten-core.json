  "description": "Molten Core is the first raid in WoW Classic. Its mechanics are relatively simple, making it a great introduction for new players, and no special gear is required to start. However, some bosses and trash packs can be extremely dangerous if mismanaged (e.g., Lava Packs, Shazzrah, Golemagg the Incinerator, Majordomo Executus, Ragnaros). Your main goal as a new player is simple: survive the raid. To achieve this, read this guide carefully, listen to the Raid Leader, and don’t hesitate to ask questions if anything is unclear.",
